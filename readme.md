The approach used in the code is a greedy algorithm that approximates the solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem.

 We take the distances as input and return the tour and the calculated total cost of that tour. The algorithm starts by visiting the first vertex  and then iteratively selects the unvisited vertex that is closest to the last visited vertex. This process continues until all vertices have been visited. Finally, the total cost of the tour is calculated.
